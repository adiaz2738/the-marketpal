                    <p>The stock market closes today, Friday, with all of the major indicies with, exception of the DOW, closing just above breakeven. This is without a doubt a very wierd market, as the market continues to climb on the slightest of good news, trips and falls to some bad news, to just pick itself back up and keep going on its marry way.</p>

                    <p>If we take a look at SPY, we can see that it's been in and out of the green, closing just barely in the green today. It's been a week of consolidation just under 300 as there's talks of a possible vaccine and even another trade war. But today, I want to discuss gaming, as I've been keeping an eye on Take-Two, which owns game development companies such as Rockstar, 2k Games, and 2k Sports, with titles such as Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and NBA 2k. (<a class="ttwo-link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TTWO?p=TTWO&.tsrc=fin-srch" title="Go to Take-Two's Yahoo Finance page" target="_blank">NASDAQ: TTWO</a>) As well as, Activision Blizzard, as I've already started a position in that one back in March. But both of which, released earings this month and have also seen a huge move in their stock price to the upside of 18% and 16%, respectively since 5/1/2020, which is really good to see if you're a shareholder of either or both companies.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Earlier in the month, ATVI released earnings for Q1 2020 and showed some really good growth. In the <a href="https://investor.activision.com/events/event-details/activision-blizzard-first-quarter-calendar-2020-results-conference-call" title="Listen to ATVI's earnings cals" target="_blank">earnings call</a>, which you can still listen to as long as it has not been more than a year since, it was said that Activision saw growth of 64% yoy, led by Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone, while Blizzard grew 21% yoy, lead by World of Warcraft. For King, Candy Crush was yet again, the top grossing game on the app store and saw more rounds played than in any other quarter since the acquisition of the company. In their slides for the earnings call, they shows that Call of Duty Modern Warfare has sold more units than any other Call of Duty title in history up until that point in its release. Call of Duty Warzone also showed some really good numbers, bringing in 60M+ players from March 10 to the day they reported earnings. Activision's net bookings for Modern Warfare doubled since compared to net bookings from Black Ops 4. Call of Duty mobile also continued to see really good growth in reach and engagement with its release of new content for season 5. Net bookings for Mobile were at their highest since season 1. Blizzard saw really good growth as well, led by World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, Overwatch, and Diablo. World of Warcraft saw really good with the relase of new content in combination with the stay at home orders. The new Shadowlands, which was very well recieved from what I could find. Overwatch's latest seasonal event prior the the release of Q1 earnings "coinsided with stay-at-home effects," which resulted in some really favorable increases in engagement.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Trough to peak from their lows in March, TTWO and ATVI have moved up 49.3% and 50.9%, respectively. They've come down from their highs quite a bit but both are still slightly over 40%, which is just astonishing.</p>

                    <p>Take-Two had the most impressive results out of the two companies, showing very strong growth over fiscal year 2020. Net revenue for the fiscal year 2020 grew 16%, compared to last fiscal year from $2.668 billion to $3.089 billion and 41% growth in net revenue for Q4 of $760.5 million, compared to $539.5 million in Q4 the previous year. The company achieved record high net bookings of nearly $3 billion as stated in the earnings call released yesterday 5/22/2020, as well as a record in digitally delivered net bookings which grew 60% yoy, as stated in their press release. Titles across the board, outperformed expectations and engagement levels with NBA 2k20 staying at "record levels" through the quarter. Daily active users (DAU) grew 13% yoy, My Team users grew 50% yoy, and 9 million hours of gameplay were watched on Twitch. This was an increase of 40% in Q3, growth which started even before the quarantine. GTA also saw record levels of Monthly Active Users (MAU) during the release of The Dimond Casino & Resort and continued to grow "sequentially" after that. Net income also grew 21% to $404.5 million compared to last fiscal year and digitally-delivered net revenues accounted for 77% of net income, growth of 41% compared to fiscal year 2019. One of the members of management also said in the earnings call, that they had 93 games planned for release over the next 5 years. <a class="link-to-release-notes" href="blog-img/releases.PNG" target="_blank"><i>(Click here</a> to take a look at the screenshot of my notes from the call related to the new releases. You can also find it for yourself in the earnings call or the press release I've linked in the <a href="#resources">"Sources"</a> section of the blog post.)</i></p>

                    <p>TTWO stock continued to move higher, making a 4%+ move to the upside the day they released earnings for Q4 and the fiscal year. Interestingly enough though, the stock made 6% move to the downside the following day. This may have happened because of one concern; how many people will actually still be playing these games once everything gets back up and running, people go back to work, students go back to school, and other forms of entertainment open up? This is a very good question because it's without a doubt that this pandemic has been a really big contributer to these gaming companies outperforming expectations like it's nothing. Jim Cramer interviewed the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, Inc., but before he got to the interview, Cramer mentioned that Take-Two acknowledged that they don't know how long all of this will last and that the stock tanked because how high the bar for this stock had been set. This was most likely one of the top reasons why and another potential expolination would just be poeple taking profits after that huge run.</p>

                    <p>This absolutely makes sense considering how incredibly good their numbers were not only for Q4, but for the whole fiscal year, it was very very good. In face, The Motley Fool even went as far as calling it "a no brainer." Another thing they pointed out towards the end of the article, was that Take-Two had a really good balance sheet, and that's absolutely true. If you take a look at the company's form 10-k, you'll see that they have $1,357B in cash and cash equivalents and ZERO long term debt. The odds are stacked in Take-Two's favor at the moment to continue to outperform.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The question that still remains, and that is yet to be answered, is still whether all of these new players will continue to play these games, watch livestreams, and spend money on microtransactions once this pandemic has run its course. I personally will continue to hold my position in ATVI for a while and I'm not sure whether I'll buy the dip with TTWO. Both stocks as well as other gaming related tech companies such as ATVI, TTWO, EA, and even NVDA with their graphics cards, since gaming is their highest contributer to their revenue. These companies definitely would have been great buys and still are if you're willing to pay the higher price, because they're really good companies with good balance sheets and plenty of really good products for their consumers. The addition of TTWO, as I said before, is still in the air but I definitely am considering buying this dip. For ATVI, I'm not sure if I want to be adding more to my position due to how far up the stock has moved already.</p>
