Key one to focus on first would be bottom line if you don't know what it is; it's basic accounting vocabulary. Then focus on learning the rest of them.</p>

I personally use the market cap formula after finding a company's intrinsic value. I will take the intrinsic value I found and multiply by the number of outstanding shares to get the market cap a company would have at the stock price I plug into the formula.</p>
